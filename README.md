# Flying Toasters Screensaver and Clock

I wanted to recreate the original After Dark flying toasters screensaver, but I didn't want to give up my [Padbury Clock screensaver](http://padbury.me/clock/).

So I combined them.

### Download

If you'd just like to use it, you can do that here: [Download](https://github.com/jamesmillerio/flying-toasters-clock/raw/master/dist/Flying%20Toasters%20Clock.zip)

If you'd like to modify this screensaver to have more/less toast and toasters, just pull down the source and change the following line of [FlyingToastersView.swift](https://github.com/jamesmillerio/flying-toasters-clock/blob/master/flyingtoasters/FlyingToasterView.swift):

> let maxToastsAndToasters: Int = 30
