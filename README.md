# Flying Toasters Screensaver and Clock

I wanted to recreate the original After Dark flying toasters screensaver, but I didn't want to give up my (Padbury Clock screensaver)[http://padbury.me/clock/].

So I combined them.

If you'd like to modify this screensaver to have more/less toast and toasters, just pull down the source and change the following line of (FlyingToastersView.swift)[https://github.com/jamesmillerio/flying-toasters-clock/blob/master/flyingtoasters/FlyingToasterView.swift]:

> let maxToastsAndToasters: Int = 30
